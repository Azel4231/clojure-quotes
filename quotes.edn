And you can't really extend that thing. \nSimilarly the flipside of that is: to the extent you have broken up your problem into reusable parts and composed them, those parts may be separable from your design and useful in another context.

#:clojure-quotes.core{:text "A big deal here is programmable interfaces. And again, for this audience, that's what Clojure has been great at. We've seen this tremendous library growth because Clojure is data-oriented, all of out libraries are data-oriented. And I think we've seen so much more just inherent, transparant, incidental, accidental, no-effort interoperability between data-driven subsystems." :quotee "Rich Hickey", :reference #:clojure-quotes.core{:url "https://youtu.be/c5p7dEZ73vA?t=2262"}}

 #:clojure-quotes.core{:text "'What is your favorite non-Java JVM language?' 'That one's a pretty easy one and that's Clojure.
