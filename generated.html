Every time I encounter something that I wish my design was better, I need to do more of this [take things apart]. Over and over again. I did not take it apart enough." - Rich Hickey</li><li>"Design helps extension. To the extent that you have broken things into separate parts, with an eye towards connecting them back together, it means that your resulting design is gonna have connection points. And when you want your system to do something new, it will be possible to do it, because there's something there. That's why design is not just about accreting up to an answer. Because when you do that you don't end up with any connecting points. And you don't end up with any building blocks. And you can't really extend that thing. 
Similarly the flipside of that is: to the extent you have broken up your problem into reusable parts and composed them, those parts may be sparable from your design and useful in another context. And that's how we get reuse. Reuse comes from design, it doesn't come from language constructs or anything like that." - Rich Hickey<br><a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Design-Composition-Performance">https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Design-Composition-Performance</a> (11:35)</br></li><li>"It's something we don't think about often enough.
