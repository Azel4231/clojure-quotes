- "Data-first programming. In the end I want my language concerned about data transformations. I don't want OOP where I'm constantly converting a "Person" to a "Student". I don't want a language where I'm considered "doing it wrong" if I keep all my data in a hashmap or a vector. (Rules out pretty much everything but Clojure)" - Timothy Baldridge

- "Well Clojure ends up being so concise that you're not very likely too see code that's in the millions of lines of code. [..] If you assume a 100x code savings in Clojure vs Java (true for most of the projects I've worked on), you're left with 10,000 lines of Clojure code. And I've worked on a ton of those." - Timothy Baldridge

 ## Sean Corfield

- "Clojure feels incredibly fluid and malleable, it’s both extremely powerful (because of its abstractions) and also extremely simple (it’s a small language, with a handful of consistent concepts). It’s great for exploring simple problems, and for building large, complex systems" - Sean Corfield

 ## Mark Engelberg

- "It's not just about concision. Yes, it's nice that you can do this in nine lines. But what's really cool about it is because I didn't need to sit down an specify all these classes about what my data was gonna look like ahead of time, I ended up with code that's more general." - Mark Engelberg

 ## Colin Fleming

- "At the conceptual level of what the application is doing, it's nearly always a flow of data through your program. And how you're manipulating that data. And all the rest is just the noise around that. That is one of the big philosophical revelations that Clojure is helping with." - Colin Fleming

- "OO is not dead here, it's just be dissected. So when you look at writing code in Clojure, and you say 'Well this doesn't look like OO at all', it's not that OO is dead an gone. It's that all the pieces of OO have been dissected and delivered separately." - Stuart Halloway

- "One of the things that happens when you write a Clojure program is that in your design you will probably identify all of the mutable state in the program. That will be a list that fits on an index card in most cases. And all the parts that are not that, you get to treat in a wholly different way. They're pure functions, they're easy to reason about, they're easy to test. And that's a whole world of better." - Stuart Halloway

- "Cross region replication is another example of something that gets crazy easier because everything is indelible. Because you have this model it's not place-oriented programming. In order to replicate from one region to another all we have to do is stream stuff from place to place. We don't have to do any coordination that's like 'Oh my god this thing changed'.

- "Commas are whitespace, so they're not shown anywhere in this notation. Most people coming from other programming languages like to see their things in their list delimited by commas. It's perfectly fine to do that [in Clojure] if you want to. Probably after a couple of weeks you'll get tired of typing the commas and start leaving them out. And then you'll start leaving them out when you're writing programs in other languages and you'll be irritated. It is a fact of life." - Stuart Halloway

- "This is the kind of advantage that I'm talking about of writing code in a dynamic language. You end up with a very, very small number of very short very general purpose things. And these pieces all have to fit together. And if everything wasn't shorter, that would suck. Because I would still want to have the roadmaps that static typing gives me. I wouldn't wanna go here. And if I had to make as many things as I would have to make to build an OO system I'd still want the types. But I make ten times fewer things on small Clojure programs and a hundred times fewer things on large Clojure programs than I would make if I had to write them in OO." - Stuart Halloway

[https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Design-Composition-Performance](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Design-Composition-Performance) (3:10)

- "Design is separating into things that can be composed." - Rich Hickey
- "Every time I encounter something I can boil it down to that. Every time I encounter something that I wish my design was better, I need to do more of this [take things apart]. Over and over again. I did not take it apart enough." - Rich Hickey
- "Design helps extension. To the extent that you have broken things into separate parts, with an eye towards connecting them back together, it means that your resulting design is gonna have connection points. And when you want your system to do something new, it will be possible to do it, because there's something there. That's why design is not just about accreting up to an answer. Because when you do that you don't end up with any connecting points. And you don't end up with any building blocks. And you can't really extend that thing. 
Similarly the flipside of that is: to the extent you have broken up your problem into reusable parts and composed them, those parts may be separable from your design and useful in another context. And that's how we get reuse. Reuse comes from design, it doesn't come from language constructs or anything like that." - Rich Hickey
[https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Design-Composition-Performance](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Design-Composition-Performance) (11:35)

- "It's something we don't think about often enough. In our programming designs and in our systems, about the actual costs of specificity. We love specificity. When we use Java every new idea gets a new class. What does that cause to happen? You get this explosion of code! Objects were supposed to support reuse, they have done the exact opposite thing. Especially in typed languages. You get very little reuse, because you make a new thing every time. " - Rich Hickey

- "Why do we base polymorphism on types alone? In the real world we don't categorize everything by a fundamental adverse type. Nobody is born a taxidriver or a painter or tall. But these typesystems work that way. You shall be tall and we'll make every decision about you based upon you being tall. Whereas most systems and most reality supports some sort of polymorphism based upon value, or current state or relationships to other things. So we need to sortof pull this stuff apart. Traditional object-orientation has put us in this rut where we can't even see the difference between these things." - Rich Hickey

- "Objects - especially in the very traditional sense or as delivered by languages like Java - boy, you just go on and on and on. What is a class? It's got state, it's got identity, it's got values, it's got operations. It's like a kitchen sink of stuff poured together. And every time you take one out to solve a problem you're starting with three or four strands already wrapped together.

- "Data. Please. We're programmers. We supposedly write data processing programs. There's all these programs that don't have any data in them. All these constructs we put around it and globbed on top of data. Data is actually really simple. There's not a tremendous number of variations in the essential nature of data. There are maps, there are sets, there are linear sequential things. There's not a lot of other conceptual categories of data. [In OO]  We create hundreds of thousands of variations that have nothing to do with the essence of the stuff, and make it hard to write programs that manipulate the essence of the stuff. We should just manipulate the essence of the stuff!" - Rich Hickey

 ## Alex Miller

- "The data parts of Clojure are fantastic. They allow us to get an amount of reuse that I never saw in any OO system I reused. Which was always the promise: there's this object and I can use it in lots of different ways. And I have not found that to be the case in practice. Whereas I find that the data centric approach and the generic programming model that Clojure provides to provide a tremendous amount of reuse." - Alex Miller

They're things, as far as my use of them, professionally to make money and to get actual work done, they're pretty much done. They do everything we need them to do. And we're moving on, you know, we're thinking about other problems now. And we don't need to keep solving these problems. And I have never experienced that before using Clojure." - Micha Niskin

- "Using other languages I could never form the abstractions that were durable and composable enough to be used in the next project. I would always end up having to rewrite something or solve the same problem over and over again. I had never experienced actually solving a problem before. Or even thinking it was something that is worth spending your time on trying to do. Like trying to solve the problem of making websites once and for all.

 ## Jon Pither

- "For me the real win with choosing a immutable functional language such as Clojure is around the 2/3 mark in a project. Just when a large traditional OO system starts to buckle under it’s own gravity and the business rules become harder to reach through the applied refactorings and introduction of design patterns, this is when a Clojure code-base will shine in comparison." - Jon Pither

 ## James Reeves

- "Haskell and Clojure have two different ideas for how to stop things from going wrong. Haskell's idea is: we're just going to build this framework of types. And when you stick within this framework of types, then you're limiting what can go wrong. [...] Clojure has a different idea and that's that things go wrong because they're too interconnected. The more things are interconnected, the harder it is for our brains to figure out what all the consequences of actions are. [...] Based on my experience it wasn't so much the types or the structure that caused me a problem, it was the interactions between things." - James Reeves

- "In a Clojure world external DSL tools, or specialized code generators will not have any future. They seem just like incidental complexity, required to make working with a broken language bearable.
