# clojure-quotes

My favorite Clojure quotes + a Clojure program to generate them as markdown and html documents

## Q&A

Q: Where are the quotes?

A: [Here](generated.md)

Q: Some references are missing

A: I know. Didn't write all of them down and forgot where I heard them. I accept pull requests though...

Q: Can I fix typos?

A: Sure. Create an issue, send me a message or create a pull request (in that case make sure to fix typos in 'quotes.edn' and regenerate 'generated.md' by calling 'lein run')

Q: I have a quote and want to contribute

A: Awesome, I'm always searching for new quotes! Send me a message or pull-request.
